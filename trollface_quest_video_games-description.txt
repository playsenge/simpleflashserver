The latest crazy installment of Troll Face Quest is finally here! Embark on a hilarious journey where you'll solve brain-teasing puzzles and try to make sense of impossible situations while trolling the most famous video game characters in history. To spare their embarrassment, we're not mentioning any names here, but the heroes of first-person shooters, Italian plumbers, fruit-craving ninjas, fearsome orcs, candy-clogged puzzles and innocent test subjects trapped in labs filled with portals won't escape Troll Face's ridiculous pranks. How do you make sense of a world that makes no sense? Is it crazy, or are you just crazy? Try to keep it together as you work your way through more than 30 wacky levels, or lose it when you get trolled for the umpteenth time.
