Quick, what do you get when you add 10 and 10? The answer is still 10, because 10 is Again! Never mind that that makes no mathematical or grammatical sense, because all that matters is that in 10 is Again, you've got to slide numbered tiles to make stacks that up to exactly ten. In this level pack, multiplication, division, and inversion tiles are added to the mix to make the math just a little wilder and the puzzling a little trickier.
