10 Years ago the Alien invasion left earth in ashes. Humanity began building civilizations in the skies while repairs continue on the ground. The military devised Express Training Programs too quickly and cheaply train soldiers. Strength in numbers. This is where the story of Raze 3 begins... As in the previous 2 editions of the series, Raze 3 lets you fight all kinds of enemies: aliens, robots, and even zombies. Collect weapons and fight them as hard as you can in this futuristic action game. Once you have saved the earth, its destiny is in your hands!
You can play in several different game modes including both a human and alien campaign, a quick match or a premium campaign. Furthermore, there are daily challenges you can complete for additional rewards. Your character can be customized to a great level of detail - change their weapon, outfit color, name, equipment and perks. Be sure to check your upgrade screen at the end of each mission as your upgrades will help your progression. This third title in the Raze series builds upon everything that made the original titles so addictive and fun!
