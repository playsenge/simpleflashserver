Trollface Quest: Horror is another funny installment of the cool Trollface Quest series, and you can play it using SimpleFlash. Halloween is around the corner and there is no better way to spend this days than watching some creepy horror movies, but the endings may not be as you remember them. Try to troll each and every character from these films, like the Werewolf weirdo, the creepy little girl from the Exorcist, a stupid Gremlin and many more.
Those quests can not be solved by applying logic so try to think outside the box and solve every single one of them. Don't get creeped out by the scary memes but instead prove that you have nerves made out of steel. Do you have what it takes to make it until the end? Is there even an end? Trolololololo!
